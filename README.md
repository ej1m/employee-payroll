# employee-payroll

I generated an employee payroll showing the hours worked, overtime pay, overtime bonus, total weekly pay and total monthly.
After populating the name (first and last), yearly wage and hours worked cells, the overtime hours were calculated using the IF command via relative referencing.
Absolute referencing of the hourly wage enabled the calculation of the weekly pay and overtime bonus.
The total weekly pay was calculated while the total monthly pay was generated using the SUM command.
Each section was color coded to enable ease of visualize.
